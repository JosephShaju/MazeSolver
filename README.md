# MazeSolver

Re-engineered a six-degree of freedom Stewart-Gough platform to solve a marble maze.The robot was designed and developed to solve any given maze by controlling the maze platform using a phone via Bluetooth.
The maze platform’s tilt and pan angles are determined by the phone’s tilt and pan angles that are obtained via the accelerometer and the gyroscope on the phone.
